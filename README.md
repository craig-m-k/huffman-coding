File compression/decompression in Python 2 using Huffman
coding.

Command line:
python hcode.py <c/d> <inputfile> <outputfile>

where 'c' compresses inputfile to outputfile and
'd' decompresses inputfile to outputfile.

Huffman class:
.data : information to code/decode. 
.header : coded Huffman tree
.footer : byte containing good bits of final data byte
.bitstream: for reading/writing to file
.asciitocode: coder dictionary
.codetoascii: decoder dictionary
.bt: Huffman object (binary tree) for coding/decoding

Compressed file structure:
  bytes 1 - 2: bytes storing value x, the size in bytes of
               stored Huffman tree
  bytes 3 - x: Huffman tree
  bytes x+1 - len(file)-1 : data
  byte len(file): a single byte indicating how many bits of the previous
                  byte should be read

Associated functions:
  code():
	Creates a dictionary for ascii-to-code or code-to-ascii.

  decode():
	Passes the data stream through the code-to-ascii dictionary.

  string_to_tree():
	Uses a heap to create the Huffman tree from the input file.

  serialize_tree():
	Creates a string representation of the Huffman tree.

  deserialize_tree(string):
	Transforms string into Huffman binary tree.

  get_freq(string):
	Returns a dictionary of character frequencies.

Things to improve:
  The BitString library is not very fast, so we should probably try to 
  minimize or eliminate its use.
